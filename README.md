# Vectraflow

During my time working at the Database Lab at Brown University, I helped develop Vectraflow - a system for integrating vectors into stream processing. We documented a research paper that was recently accepted to CIDR 2025 (Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research).

The codebase is currently private, but please read the research paper [here](Vectraflow.pdf)!
